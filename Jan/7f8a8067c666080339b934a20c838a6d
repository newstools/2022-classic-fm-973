US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are currently holding talks in Geneva, amid mounting fears that Russia could be about to invade Ukraine. "This is a critical moment," Mr Blinken said in his opening remarks. The US and Russia "don't expect to resolve our differences here today", he added, but hoped to test whether diplomacy was still a viable option. The summit between the top US and Russian diplomats follows moves by Mr Blinken to secure US allies' backing for sanctions against Moscow.  US President Joe Biden had this week predicted that Russia "will move in" on Ukraine and warned of grave consequences for Russia. However, Moscow, which has 100,000 troops at the border has repeatedly denied plans to invade.  President Vladimir Putin had earlier issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He wants the Western defensive alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to Eastern Europe, which Moscow sees as its backyard. At a press conference after the meeting, Mr Lavrov described the talks as open and useful; while he accused Nato of working against Russia. He reiterated Moscow's position that it has "never threatened the Ukrainian people" and has no plans to attack Ukraine.
