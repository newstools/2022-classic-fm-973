The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has denied any security threat to the Nation's capital, Abuja orchestrated by some foreign terrorists.  Speaking to State House Correspondents after the National Security presided by President Muhammadu Buhari, against the backdrop of a leaked memo by Nigeria Immigration Service revealing plot by terrorists to attack the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, the Minister said the memo is just an operational alert that requires less worry, as he assured Nigerians of adequate safety during the festive season and beyond.  On his part, Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba reiterated that Mr President has given matching orders to security agencies to massively deploy human, intelligence and other operational assets of Forces at their disposal to ensure security and safety of citizens and critical national infrastructure across the country.  Earlier in a statement signed by DCP, Frank Mba, the IGP had ordered Commissioners of Police (CPs) in the thirty-six (36) States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja as well as their supervisory Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs), to initiate and implement well-coordinated crime prevention strategies and ensure round-the-clock visibility patrols towards peaceful Christmas and New Year celebrations in the country.  The IGP also warned Police personnel deployed for duties during the yuletide season, particularly those deployed to secure the highways across the country, to desist from acts inimical to discipline and professionalism.  The IGP equally enjoined citizens to cooperate with officers deployed for the assignments especially by being law abiding, noting that the Force remains sensitive to issues of rights violations, illegitimate use of force and has since deployed the Monitoring Unit, the X-Squad, and the Force Provost Unit on joint operation nationwide with a view to monitoring conducts of officers.
