The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, says it is clear that it is not possible to remove subsidy on petroleum products due to some impediments.  He said this during a meeting with Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Monday in Abuja over the planned removal of subsidy on petroleum products by the Federal Government. According to Timipre, it is clear that it is not possible at this time for the government to remove the subsidy.  In his remarks, Lawan faulted the timing of the planned subsidy removal. He said that in as much as the administration and management of subsidy on petroleum products were flawed, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government believed  that sufficient planning must be carried out before its eventual removal.  Lawan also appealed to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) to stop their planned protest against the proposed removal of fuel subsidy, indicting that the move was unnecessary. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, who was at the meeting, on her part said that the Federal Government made provisions for fuel subsidy in the 2022 Budget – from January to June.  According to her, all payments on fuel subsidy ordinarily would cease asfrom July 2022. She said that in view of the timing which was “problematic”, the government decided not to go ahead with the removal of subsidy in July, particularly against the backdrop of outcomes from ongoing consultations. She added that the Federal Government was exploring alternatives to premium motor spirit as well as pushing to step up the country’s crude oil refining capacity.  The labour unions had planned to hold a protest from January 27 over the planned subsidy removal
