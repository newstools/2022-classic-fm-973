Candidates sitting the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), can now pick Computer Studies or Physical and Health Education (PHE) as part of their four UTME subjects, if they so desire or as dictated by their program preferences.  The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), in its weekly bulletin released on Monday by the Director of Public Relations, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, said the development is to enhance the career prospects of students transiting to tertiary institutions, as the two subjects are added to the existing 23 UTME subjects to make them 25 beginning from the 2022 UTME exercise. The exam board has also announced some adjustments to its 2022 examination timelines as some of the dates on the previous examination timeline clashed with other examinations. The new timeline sees the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) would be held from Friday, 6th to Monday, 26th May 2022, while the Mock-UTME exercise earlier scheduled for 2nd April 2022 would now be held on 16th April 2022, for candidates who registered early and indicated their willingness to sit for the Mock UTME. However, the date for the commencement of sale of the 2022 UTME/DE application document which was slated to start from 12th February to 19th March 2022 remains as stated earlier.  Meanwhile, as part of the intensive preparations for a hitch-free 2022 UTME/DE registration exercise, JAMB is putting finishing touches to all arrangements for the institution of an additional USSD code to be used by candidates besides the 55019 code that had been in operation since 2018 for registration and other essential services offered by the board. The 55019 code is used to create profiles for registration by candidates who are required to send their National Identification Number (NIN) via the code for their details to be pulled from the NIMC database before proceeding to a certified center for their biometric capturing.
